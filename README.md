# Javascript Web Programming

## Class Rules 

- Always be respectful of yourself and others. 
- Give credit where credit is due.
- Have fun! 

## Introductions 

- We'll play the name game to get to know our fellow programmers! Think of something you like which starts with the same letter as your first name. For example, my name is "Matt" and I like "Machines". Both start with the letter "M". Make sense? Let's try it together! 

## What is Programming? 

We are all going to learn to be programmers. 

- Programming - Creating a written set of instructions that tells what a computer what to do.
- Javascript - A programming language which powers the web and runs in the browser.

Lets looks at some awesome examples!

## The Tools Programmers Use 

In this class we will use a few tools which are free so you can download them at home too. 

- Atom.io https://atom.io/
- Chrome Web Browser: https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/features.html 
- Github https://github.com/kidsdigitalu

We will also be using 2 code libraries which are open source. This means you can use them freely in your projects, so long as you give credit.

- 2d https://p5js.org/
- 3d https://aframe.io/

## Your First Program: Hello world! 

Every programmers first program is called "hello world". Lets write your first program now! 

We'll write "hello world" to the console which is a place were other programmers can see your message! What else can we program in the console? 

# Project 1: Program your favorite animal with Javascript    

We'll be using P5 for this and following the getting start guide available here: https://p5js.org/get-started/

Create a new folder on the desktop with your name. This is where your files will go. 

You should reference the documentation and examples available here: https://p5js.org/

First think about shapes that make up your animal. Then think about colors, textures, and sounds.
